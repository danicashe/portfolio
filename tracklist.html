        <p>A native mobile app for iOS and Android for users to create various watchlists for their various East Asian shows. I conducted research on other existing apps to get an idea of what functions are necessary, as well as what functions
          I felt were missing that I wanted to include in my design.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study">
      <div>
        <h2>1 - The Idea</h2>
        <p>As someone who watches a lot of shows from East Asia, I've found it difficult to keep track of all the shows I'm watching because there's no single platform where anime, dramas, and variety shows are compiled together.</p>
        <p>I designed this app with people like me in mind, who watch a lot of different types of shows but don't want to have their watch lists scattered across multiple platforms and websites.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img\tracklist\Idea@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img\tracklist\Idea@1x.jpg" alt="tracklist Idea">
        </picture>

        <h2>2 - Objective</h2>
        <p>Create a native app on Android and iOS that allows users to keep track of these different types of shows in one place, create watchlists that combine shows of different media types, and keep track of their viewing progress.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img\tracklist\Objective@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img\tracklist\Objective@1x.jpg" alt="tracklist Objective">
        </picture>

        <h2>3 - Purpose</h2>
        <p>Allow users to organize shows across multiple types of East Asian media (i.e. anime, dramas, variety shows) into lists and keep track of their viewing progress.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img\tracklist\Purpose@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img\tracklist\Purpose@1x.jpg" alt="tracklist Purpose">
        </picture>

        <h2>4 - Research</h2>
        <p>An app that allows users to save shows and track their viewing progress isn't a new idea, so first I checked out a few similar apps to see what features are necessary and what features I'd like that are missing.</p>
        <p>First I analyzed how the apps designed their screens to analyze them for similarities and differences. For example, on the browsing screens, they all used the same side-scrolling pattern. One of them included a "see all" button that
          allowed users to browse titles with vertical scrolling.</p>
        <p>Next, I made note of the elements used in each app. For example, every app had some version of a progress bar to help users track their viewing progress.</p>
        <p>Lastly, I looked at what features I missed as a user. None of the apps allow users to make multiple watch lists, which reassured my decision to keep this feature as one of my app's key functions to set it apart from others.</p>

          <img src="img\tracklist\Research@1x.jpg" alt="tracklist Research">
        </picture>

        <h2>5 - User Flow</h2>
        <p>Now that I had a good idea of what features I wanted to include and what screens would be necessary for them, I moved on to creating a user flow for the app.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img\tracklist\User_Flow@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img\tracklist\User_Flow@1x.jpg" alt="tracklist User Flow">
        </picture>

        <h2>6 - Low & Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>With the structure of the app in place, I began designing the screens. I started with low-fidelity wireframes and then further refined the designs with mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img\tracklist\Low_Mid_Wireframes@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img\tracklist\Low_Mid_Wireframes@1x.jpg" alt="tracklist Low & Mid-Fidelity Wireframes">
        </picture>

        <h2>7 - High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>Since Android and iOS use many similar patterns, I used the low and mid-fidelity wireframes as the basis for both systems and made adjustments as necessary.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I really enjoyed creating this project because it's closely related to one of my biggest interests, which is East Asian media. A common struggle is keeping track of viewing progress across different platforms, so I thought a tool that
          would help keep everything in one place would be useful and fun to design.

        <h4>Roadblocks</h4>
        <p>The only significant setback I had was deciding how to display the shows. Many apps use a side-scrolling option, but I wanted to allow users to scan titles without interrupting their browsing by opening pages, so I decided to use vertical
          scrolling with three thumbnails per row.</p>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>I developed a greater appreciation for common patterns while working on this project. It made it much easier to create consistent designs across platforms and allowed me to prioritize convenience and function instead of trying to come up
          with something innovative when it isn't necessary.</p>

        <h4>What I Would Do Differently</h4>
        <p>The process itself went rather smoothly for this project. However, if I were designing the app from the beginning again, I would think more about how newer functions might be integrated as the app gets updated and find a place for them in
          the initial designs.</p>
        <p>For example, I would like to provide users with the option to share lists with friends which would require space to include a share icon and a friends list at the very least.</p>
