        <p>A mobile and web app for users to set short-term financial goals and manage their budgets to achieve them. I referred to the project brief to create a brand guideline that suited the client’s needs, then applied them to the screen
          designs while making necessary adjustments throughout the process.</p>

    </div>

        <h2>1 - The Idea</h2>
        <p>Saving money can be really hard, especially when you don’t have a long time to do so. By providing personalized information on how a user can save based on their actual finances, MoneyTree can provide financial advice during these finite
          periods of saving.</p>

        <h2>2 - The Objective</h2>
        <p>To create and design a budgeting app that helps users who are familiar with the technology, but who don't like working with their finances, manage their savings in order to reach short-term financial goals.</p>

        <h2>3 - Brainstormingthe Design</h2>
        <p>Before anything else, I began by thinking about what the overall tone and style of the app would be. Finances are usually a topic of stress and anxiety, so I knew I wanted the app to be calm and relaxing.</p>
        <p>At the same time, money is often talked about in relation to growth and prosperity. Combined with the feeling of calm, I decided that a theme revolving around nature and plants would be appropriate for the app.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>4 - Project Brief & Preliminary Guidelines</h2>
        <p>After deciding on a theme, I moved on to designing some preliminary assets for the app according to the project brief I was provided. This included the logo, the colour palette, and the typography.</p>
        <picture>

        </picture>

        <h2>5 - User Flow</h2>
        <p>Once I got a clearer idea of the overall direction of this project, I started thinking about the structural components of the app. I began by drafting the user flow to ensure that the app would include only the essentials. That way users
          can find the information they need quickly and easily.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>6 - User Stories</h2>
        <p>I then created low-fidelity wireframes based on a few user stories. This gave me a starting point for the visual design and allowed me to break down the design process into smaller steps.</p>
        <picture>

        </picture>

        <h2>7 - Low & Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After starting with a few key user flows, I drafted low-fidelity wireframes for the rest of the screens and polished the designs to create mid-fidelity wireframes.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/moneytree/Lo_Mid_Wireframes@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </picture>

        <h2>8 - User Testing</h2>
        <p>At this stage, I conducted some user testing to refine the details in the screens. This way I could still make adjustments easily before finalizing the designs.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/moneytree/User_Testing@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </picture>

        <h2>9 - Final Brand Guidelines</h2>
        <p>With the structure of screens now finalized, I updated the brand guidelines accordingly and created mockups, then applied the elements to the final screens.</p>

        <h3>Guiding Principles</h3>
        <h4>Trustworthy</h4>
        <p>Our mission is to provide a reliable tool to organize your personal finances. Keeping user information secure is our utmost priority.</p>

        <h4>Simple</h4>
        <p>MoneyTree provides users with only the relevant information in a clear and direct way that they need to take control of their own finances. No fuss, no muss.</p>

        <h4>Hardworking</h4>
        <p>Helping our users organize their finances is an important responsibility, one that we take seriously. There's no cutting corners at MoneyTree.</p>

          <source srcset="img" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img" alt="moneytree ">
        </picture>

        <h3>Imagery & Style</h3>
        <p>Imagery is clean and bright to capture the relaxing, positive feel of our app.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/moneytree/Imagery_Style@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/moneytree/Imagery_Style@1x.jpg" alt="moneytree Imagery & Style">
        </picture>

        <h4>Mature</h4>
        <p>MoneyTree is for users who are serious about reaching their financial goal, so it's important to match that sincerity. Avoid being condescending or patronizing when presenting information or addressing users.</p>

        <h4>Approachable</h4>
        <p>Language doesn't need to be overly formal. Users should feel like they're consulting a reliable friend. However, avoid excessive jokes and especially puns to maintain professionalism and trust.</p>

        <h4>Accessible</h4>
        <p>World choice should be direct. Avoid using technical jargon. Keep things short and to the point.</p>

        <h2>10 - High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I applied the changes suggested from the user feedback and finalized the design. I included more information such as how much the user should save per day to meet their deadline and specified which numbers mean what by adding more headers.
        </p>
        <p>At this stage, the biggest challenge incorporating the feedback without crowding the screens. My solution was to use common patterns, such as menu tabs and buttons, so users can intuitively locate different types of information.</p>

        </picture>
        <p>I worked outside of my area of expertise for this project, so it was a good opportunity to create a design as though it was for a real client.</p>

        <h4>Roadblocks</h4>
        <p>There's a lot of information, specifically numbers, in a financial app, so I spent a lot of time figuring out how to structure all the information in a way that was still visually appealing.</p>
        <p>I used patterns menu tabs to organize information into larger categories, and incorporated buttons so users can tap certain areas to see more details. I also presented important information as full sentences for clarity.</p>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>I learned to be more strategic with my use of colour when designing this app. In previous projects they were mostly for aesthetic, but here I used colours to be more informative and functional.</p>
        <p>For example, I used red to inform the users where they've gone over budget and green to highlight important values on the screen.</p>

        <h4>What I Would Do Differently</h4>
        <p>This app has a lot of numerical data, all of which mean different things on each page. As a result, I ended up forgetting some information or failed to provide clarity on what the numbers meant.</p>
        <p>If I designed this app from the beginning again, I would start by outlining what kind of data is needed on each screen and refer back to it frequently so I don't accidentally forget a piece of information in the later stages of design.</p>
