        <p>A responsive web app to discover, share, and learn about East Asian cuisine. I conducted user research through user interviews to get a better understanding of the target audience. I also created early-stage prototypes and conducted
          A/B testing to polish my screen designs throughout the process.</p>

        <h2>1 - The Idea</h2>
        <p>For many children of immigrants, food is a major part of cultural identity. Many would like to learn how to cook dishes from their culture, but have difficulty finding a place to start.</p>
        <p>Second Chef provides a single resource for East Asian recipes to help second-generation diaspora connect with their respective cultures through food.</p>

        <h2>2 - Objective</h2>
        <p>Create a responsive web app that allows users to discover, favourite, and share East Asian recipes on multiple devices, as well as find information about the ingredients used.</p>

        <h2>3 - User Research</h2>
        <p>In order to gain a broader understanding of the target audience, I recruited peers to conduct user interviews. I asked the participants questions related to their relationships with their culture, their cooking habits, and what they'd like
          to see in this type of app.</p>
        <p>I used the information from these interviews to create user profiles to represent the different types of people who would use this app. This allows me to keep the target audience in mind and ensure that my future designs satisfy the needs
          and wants of the users.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>4 - User Stories</h2>
        <p>Based on the user research, I defined the key user stories that would be necessary to create a minimum viable product while still integrating features that are unique to my app, such as an emphasized focus on information and ingredients.
        </p>

        </picture>

        <h2>5 - User Flow</h2>
        <p>With the user stories acting as a structural guideline, I created a user flow to determine what screens would be necessary to accomplish each task and how they would connect.</p>

        <h2>6 - Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I sketched some initial screen designs to get an idea of where all the information would be located so that users can navigate the app efficiently and intuitively.</p>
        <p>At this stage I was inadvertently designing a mobile app rather than a responsive web app, which is an error that I corrected later in the process.</p>

        <h2>7 - Prototype & Testing</h2>
        <p>I created a prototype with the low-fidelity wireframes to test the initial structure of the app. This was to ensure that the screens are readable and that the app's design is functional even without any aesthetics.</p>
        <p>I then recruited participants and provided a few tasks for them to complete user the prototype. This helped determine whether the designs work as intended, as well as locate any missing functions or other weak points.</p>

        <h2>8 - Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After using my prototype and user testing to confirm that the structure of my app is sound, I moved on to improving the quality of the wireframes.</p>
        <p>At this stage I started thinking about the finer details, such as the form that users would fill out to create a recipe, and how other small elements like the filters would look.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>9 - Style Guide</h2>
        <p>Before moving on to the high-fidelity wireframes, I created a style guide to give myself a better idea of what I wanted the final product to look like.</p>
        <p>I wanted to create an app with a positive and exciting feel, so centered the design around warm colours and bright imagery.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>10 - Copy & Language Guide</h2>
        <p>Casual, straightforward, encouraging, sincere. As an app targeted towards a young adult audience, the language should be easy to digest without being condescending or patronizing.</p>
        <p>Users are here to hone a skill, celebrate their culture, and educate themselves about it along with others. As such, language should create a suitable learning environment that encourages self-teaching, positivity, and exploration.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>11 - High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After designing the initial style guide, I created the final screen designs and adjusted any colours or elements accordingly.</p>
        <p>At this stage, I corrected my error and changed the overall design from a mobile app to a responsive web app.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>12 - Preference Testing</h2>
        <p>When creating the high-fidelity wireframes, I used preference testing to polish them. I presented participants with two versions of the same screen and had them select which they preferred and why. This allowed me to continue with the
          design that was most appealing and usable to the target audience.</p>

        </picture>

        <h2>13 - Responsive Designs</h2>
        <p>I then used responsive resizing to create screens at different breakpoints, making adjustments to the layout as necessary so it was suitable for the new size of the screen.</p>

        <h2>14 - Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I chose to this project because many second-generation East Asians want to learn how to cook the foods of their cultures, but there's currently no single, reliable source for these recipes. Food and culture go hand in hand, so I also
          wanted to incorporate an educational aspect to the app that allows users to learn about their own cultures and each other's.</p>

        <h4>Roadblocks</h4>
        <p>My biggest roadblock was more of an oversight. Instead of creating a responsive design, my initial designs were actually for a mobile app.</p>
        <p>I didn't realize this until I'd already created the high-fidelity wireframes, so going back to change this was very time-consuming.</p>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>Through user testing, I gained a better understanding of intuitive design, such as what shapes users associate with what functions and where they expect to find these functions. This allowed me to make more conscious decisions when
          incorporating familiar patterns in a new way so the interface would still be intuitive.</p>
        <p>For example, I designed buttons for the ingredient list. Normally the ingredients are just a text list, but the box design lets users see that this is something that they can interact with, and the familiar pattern lets them accurately
          predict the outcome.</p>

        <h4>What I Would Do Differently</h4>
        <p>For this project, I followed the steps provided and designed the screens using the mobile-first approach. This worked well until I was creating responsive designs for the high-fidelity wireframes all at once.</p>
        <p>If I did the project again, I would try drafting just one or two responsive web designs with the most important screens. I think allowing myself to deviate a little from the standard process would give me a clearer vision of what the next
          steps will be, and would make it easier for me to spot any weak points or errors in the design sooner rather than later.</p>
        <p>For example, the main reason I didn't realize I was designing a mobile app instead of a responsive app was because I hadn't started on the desktop screens yet. It was only at that stage when I realized the bottom navigation bar didn't make
          sense for this project.</p>
