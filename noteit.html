        <p>A mobile app created for students to help keep track of assignments and manage short-term schedules. For this project, I referred to common patterns that are commonly used for checklist and calendar apps, then refined them to suit my
          appâ€™s style and focus.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="case-study" id="case-study">
      <div>
        <h2>1 - Objective</h2>
        <p>Create an app that allows students to manage class schedules, assignments, and study plans while on the go, all in one place.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Objective@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </picture>

        <h2>2 - Style</h2>
        <p>Noteit is designed to be a clean, minimalist app that provides students with just the essentials to manage their schedules.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Style@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        <h2>3 - Functions</h2>
        <p>The functionalities of the app were outlined in the brief. The focus of the app was designed around these functions.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Functions@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/noteit/Functions@1x.jpg" alt="NoteIt Functions">
        </picture>

        <h2>4 - Research</h2>
        <p>Competitor apps were analyzed in order to gain a better understanding of how these functionalities are applied and in what ways they could be improved to suit this app.</p>
        <p>A common issue was that many apps included several functions that certain subgroups within a potential userbase might use, but not everyone within the userbase would use regularly.</p>
        <p>Since Noteit has a specific target audience in mind, the functions are limited to what would be relevant to students: a checklist to keep track of assignments and a calendar.</p>

        <h2>5 - Low-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>I started the design process by drafting a few ideas onto paper. My focus at this time was determining how many screens the app would need and where to place the elements on each screen.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Low_Fidelity_Wireframes@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </picture>

        <h2>6 - Mid-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>When I started digitizing the low-fidelity wireframes, I also started polishing the designs of each element to add more detail to the functions.</p>
        <p>At this stage, I started experimenting with different ways to places all the buttons with unique functions while still keeping the design minimalist and clean.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Mid_Fidelity_Wireframes@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        </picture>

        <h2>7 - High-Fidelity Wireframes</h2>
        <p>After reaching a final solution for the designs, I refined them into high-fidelity wireframes. I incorporated the style guide and refined the placement of each element to ensure that everything is properly aligned and pixel perfect.</p>

        <h4>Signup</h4>
        <p>Creating a user profile allows users to access their data on different mobile devices.</p>
        <picture>

          <img src="img/noteit/Signup@1x.jpg" alt="NoteIt Signup">
        </picture>

        <h4>Tasklist</h4>
        <p>The task list is organized into different categories. Users can add items under each category and break down each item into steps to keep track of their progress.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Tasklist1@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">
          <img src="img/noteit/Tasklist1@1x.jpg" alt="NoteIt Tasklist1">
        </picture>

        <p>Users can assign deadlines to each category or item. Lists are automatically organized by earliest deadline.</p>

          <img src="img/noteit/Tasklist2@1x.jpg" alt="NoteIt Tasklist2">
        </picture>

        <p>Users can sort their lists by name, number of tasks, or deadline. They can sort the items manually by holding and dragging the items individually.</p>

        </picture>

        <h4>Schedule</h4>
        <p>The app includes a calendar function so users can manage their short-term schedules. This is to help users prioritize without overwhelming them with tasks that are still several weeks away.</p>
        <picture>
          <source srcset="img/noteit/Schedule@0.5x.jpg" media="(max-width:767px)">

        <h4>Profile</h4>
        <p>Users can manage their account information and change the colour scheme of the app.</p>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>I created the type of app I would've liked to have when I was a student: something that helps me break down big assignments into smaller tasks, track my progress, and plan my short-term schedules without overwhelming me with too many
          options on how to do it.</p>

        <h4>Roadblocks</h4>
        <p>My biggest roadblock was designing the buttons for the tasks themselves. I wanted to give users three main functions on the home screen: view course details, open the course page, and manually reorder the course list.</p>
        <p>In my original design, I only had one right arrow inside the button to indicate that users could tap on the button to view course details. The intention was to have two hotspots on the same button. Tapping the course title would
          expand/collapse the details, and tapping the arrow would bring users to the course page.</p>
        <p>However, this created confusion regarding the function of the design since the result is one button with two functions.</p>
        <p>My initial solution was to add an arrow outside the button on the left side so users could see that they had the option to expand or collapse. However, this cluttered the screen with too many unique buttons, and the arrows looked too
          similar.</p>
        <p>My revised solution by removing the expand button and placing the right arrow outside the course button. This separates the two functions visually and makes it more clear that each design only has one function.</p>
        <p>Now, tapping the course button expands/collapses the details, tapping the right arrow brings users to the course page, and users still have the option to click and drag the courses to rearrange them as they like.</p>

        <h4>What I Learned</h4>
        <p>I learned the importance of setting up a good library of elements at the beginning stages of digitizing wireframes.</p>
        <p>Since I was still focused more on polishing designs at the beginning, I didn't spend a lot of time making sure my components were consistent or being used correctly. This caused my work to be inefficient in the later stages when I had to
          go back and edit several elements manually.</p>

        <h4>What I Would Do Differently</h4>
        <p>Although it wasn't required for this project, I would create a low-fidelity prototype and conduct user testing if I could do it again.</p>
        <p>Getting more immediate and direct feedback would've helped speed up the design process, which likely would have allowed me to reach my final design solution much more quickly and smoothly.</p>
        <p>For similar reasons, I would have spent a little more time sketching the structure of the buttons.</p>
        <p>I was thinking more broadly in terms of the layout of the page, but I think I would have benefitted from sketching more detailed ideas for the buttons themselves at this stage.</p>
        <p>This is because once I start digitizing wireframes, I have a tendency to get carried away with polishing them and end up refining a design that isn't necessarily functional.</p>
        <p>This is what happened with the course buttons, so it took me more time than necessary to go back and redesign them.</p>
